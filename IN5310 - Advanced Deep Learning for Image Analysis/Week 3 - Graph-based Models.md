## What is a graph
* Way to structure data and relationships
* Everything doesn't need to be directly connected
* Vertices and edges
* Could be directional and/or weighted
* Can be represented in multiple different ways
* Structure itself can indicate similarity


A graph is a datastructure consisting of nodes and edges, used to represent relationships between the nodes


## Message passing
* Each node only knows about itself at the start, but useful to know the full picture
* Different ways to pass messages: node to node, node to graph, node to edge...
	* Create a global node connected to all others
* Could be pooling (from neighbours), learn information from neighbours
	* Updates itself
