## Classifying videos using GNNs and superpixels

### Topic question
* If GCN/GAT architecture and superpixels for classification is a viable option - proof of concept
### Objectives
* Extend superpixels to 3d
* Performance: Complexity Theory & Accuracy
* Evaluate performance of different GNN architectures
### Theories
* Less processing to only use Superpixels
* Superpixels better for attention then ViT?
### Preprocessing
* Choose a set number of frames from the middle
* Pick preprocessing based on baseline model
### Evaluation
* Resources - Flops
* Complexity analysis
* Compare with external results for the dataset as a baseline
### External resources
#### Baselines

#### Papers

### Breakdown
* Superpixels implementation and theory (philip)
* Data implementation and theory (noemi)
* Making model implementation and theory (eirik)
* Training model (everyone)
* Complexity theory (philip)
* Evaluation (evaluation)
