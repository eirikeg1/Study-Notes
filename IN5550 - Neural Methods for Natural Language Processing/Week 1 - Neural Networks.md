# Linear models vs neural models
---

## Linear classifiers
* Efficient and effective
* Interpretable to a degree (you can find the most important features by looking at the weights)
* Can be used on their own (often enough in practice), or as building blocks for non-linear neural classifiers
* Can unfortunately only work on linearly separable datasets

## Neural models
