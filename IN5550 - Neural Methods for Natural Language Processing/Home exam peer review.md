## Significance of the work

## Typos/rewrite
* 006 - paramters
* 213 - trained twice
* 4.2 title -double capital letters
* 242 - no period

## Good stuff
* Good analysis
	* Good justification for decoders better results
	* Good thorough analysis for BLiMP results (289). As someone not very good at grammatical/syntactical rules it is easy to follow.
* Good explanation on preprocessing steps

## Other improvements
* Use more formal language:
	* On line 093 instead of _In addition to the datsets already provided, I needed an ESL-dataset to subsitute for the 094 CHILDES dataset._, perhaps better to write _An ESL dataset was necessary to replace the 094 CHILDES dataset, in addition to the provided datasets._
	* On line 379: _The third observation we can make, is that even though my TSCC decoder-model lost to the CHILDES decoder-model by a whisker, it still won overall when taking the encoder and encoder- decoder models into account_
	* On line 444: _The conclusion so far, must be that tiny LM’s didn’t_
* Split into shorter paragraphs, for example in chapter 2 Data and preprocessing one paragraph covers 19 lines and multiple different topics
* Back statements more with sources:
	* 423: might be useful to either give an example or link to study. _Most LM’s don’t do well on the LAMBADA 424 metric_
