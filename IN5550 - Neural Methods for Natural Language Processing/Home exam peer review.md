## Significance of the work

## Typos/rewrite
* 006 - paramters

## Good stuff
* Good analysis
	* Good justification for decoders better results
	* Good thorough analysis for BLiMP results (289). As someone not very good at grammatical/syntactical rules it is easy to follow.
* Good explanation on preprocessing steps

## Other improvements
* Use more formal language, on line 093 instead of _In addition to the datsets already provided, I needed an ESL-dataset to subsitute for the 094 CHILDES dataset._, perhaps better to write _An ESL dataset was necessary to replace the 094 CHILDES dataset, in addition to the provided datasets._
* Split into shorter paragraphs, for example in chapter 2 Data and preprocessing one paragraph covers 19 lines and multiple different topics
