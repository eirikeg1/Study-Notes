# What is a platform ecosystem?
---
_A platform ecosystem consists of a software platform that provides core functionality and interfaces for apps that extend its capabilities_

**Book is based on two premises**
1. The migration of competition from products to platforms, in both technology and non-technology industries, requires a different mindset for managing them
2. Evolvability in unforeseeable ways is key to thriving platform markets but is rarely the dominant emphasis in complex software systems

## Some Takeaways
* A platform without at least two distinct groups is not a platform. A true platform must be at least two-sided and span at least two distinct groups such as developers or end users, which interact with each other through the platform
* Platforms that thrive are the ones who's ecosystem outpace rival ones in the evolutionary race. They are the ones who drive these changes is usually based on the five drivers of migration
* Platforms can be owned by one or multiple owners, and can be either for-profit or non-profit. But we refer to the lead firm primarily responsible for the platform as the **Platform owner**
* Software-based platforms no longer only apply to software companies, now companies in all industries use them in some way. The five drivers are affecting all industries
* Platforms are changing the rules of competition. Companies are now migrating to rival platform ecosystems


# Elements of a Platform Ecosystem
---
*Is build up of two major components: the software platform and it's complementary apps*

## Software platform
_Software-based product or service that serves as a foundation on which outside parties can build complementary products or service, which is a foundation which can be built upon_

* Main goal is to make the platform enabling core technologies, in order to allow a wide array of complementary apps

## Complementary apps
_An app refers to an add-on software subsystem or software service that connects to the platform to extend it's functionality_

* The more different apps, the more desirable the product

## Additional elements
* **Ecosystem**
	* The collection of the platform and the apps specific to it
* **Interfaces**
	* Specifications that describe how to platform and apps interact and exchange information
	* Includes API's and protocols
* **Architectures**
	* A conceptual blueprint which describes how the ecosystem is partitioned into a relatively stable platform and a complementary set of apps that are encouraged to vary, and the design rules binding on both
* An ecosystem can also be divided into its **upstream** and **downstream** parts:
	* The **upstream** part of the value chain is what goes into producing the platform itself (components, hardware, manufacturing partners,...)
	* The **downstream** part of the value chain includes platform developers, end-users, intermediaries between platform owner and end users (retailers and carriers etc.)
	* **Downstream** complements are bundled together based on the users needs, therefore the usefulness to an end-user is not the platform itself but what is derived from it

# The five drivers of migration to PE
---
_Recent advances in technology are increasingly making it possible to reconfigure traditional industries, there are five main factors which accelerate these changes_

* These can be essential for a company to thrive, many big giants have fallen because of not realizing the importance of these
* These can make business models obsolete and can adapt the mindset needed to succeed in the industry

## Deepening specialization
_Increased need for deep expertise due to growing complexity of products and services_

* Software lines of code is expected to double every 2 years. In order to keep up it is essential to have the expertise to do so.
* No company, no matter how big has the expertise or manpower to innovate in every industry. As the knowledge needed to deliver increasingly complex products and services becomes more dispersed across many firms, companies should focus on their core specialization and depend on the rest from capable partners.
* Location dependance and coordination costs have often been constraints to keep firms from collaborating. But with the five drivers of migration and developments like making it easier to break down tasks into smaller tasks, it has become easier and more efficient to spread the expertise over multiple vendors.

**Consequences:**
* Simultaneously shrinking and expanding firm boundaries
	* It is becoming more and more important that companies focuses their resources primarily on their specialization, and leave the other part to companies who specialize in the respective field. But as markets change these boundaries might change a lot and fast.
	* Companies are under pressure to to more of what they are good at and less of everything else
* The Red Queen effect
	* Is and hypothesis that it takes increasing expertise and resources in order to 'stay in the same place'
	* Not keeping up with the competition can have dramatic consequences (for example Blackberry's slow development compared to Apple's)
* Increased need for integration of distributed expertise
	* Traditional methods of management (authority, command-and-control, contracts,...) might not be effective in a market where many independent companies are working together

## Packetization
_The ability to digitize an activity, process, product or service_

* Digital 'packets' can be transported and processed very fast and efficiently at a low cost
* It removes the old restrictions of localization and makes room for a lot of potential benefits
* It is not required to be done a large scale digitization, there are three main ways to do so:
	1. The product or service itself
	2. How it is transacted or purchased
	3. How it is delivered

**Consequences:**
* Breaks the constraint of location-dependence
	* Allows more ways of division of labor, which can open up a possibility for a parallel economy which is faster, more productive and more diverse than the physical one
* Leads to the need for deepening specialization
	* Can foster innovation and efficiency, but also require more coordination and integration among partners


## Software embedding
_Baking routine business processes or activity into software_

* An activity can now more seamlessly move between physical and digital realms, creating new opportunities and possibilities
* For example when ordering from McDonalds the order processing, payment processing, coupon validation and more is all embedded in software instead of being managed by people 
* Opens more opportunities, can make products more like software platforms, allowing others to make custom apps for them

**Consequences:**
* Transformation of products into services
	* Can give more opportunities, but can also lead to 'lock-in' (you have to use this specific software), subscriptions or dependency on other partners
* Morphing of the digital-physical boundary
	* Requires more attention to the software part of the company
	* Physical companies becomes more and more software companies
* Convergence across industries
	* Requires even more expertise in multiple fields. Might require depending more on other partners

## Internet of Things
_Allows everyday objects to be embedded with inexpensive sensors to directly communicate using the same protocols that connect the internet_

* The declining costs and increasing production of semiconductors allows everyday object to be digitalized, leading to minor improvements everywhere
* Companies will need to adapt to this

**Consequences:**
* Generation of a massive amount of data streams from networked objects
	* Businesses gather, process and sell/utilize data for profit
* Increased context awareness
	* Networked objects can communicate contextual information like location, surroundings and temperature in real time. This makes them smarter and more capable which opens up for multiple new opportunities
	* However handling so many possible different factors require much more knowledge and specialization than before in order to increase efficiency

## Ubiquity
_The increasingly growing cheaper and faster wireless data networks build around the internet protocol_

* Since it is becoming increasingly more efficient to packetize data and communication the market is changing rapidly
* Since almost all packets use the same protocol (**TCP/IP**), it allows pretty much everything which can be packetized to be delivered and used almost anywhere

**Consequences:**
* Allows loosely coupled networks of small firms to rival the efficiencies of large firms
	* By banding together multiple small firms it turns the conventional model of scale through ownership to one without ownership
* Local businesses become less dominant as other businesses becomes more and more feasible
* Allows companies to crowd-source or 'un-source' activities to their customers, who can help solve problems and activities which previously had to be done by in house employees
