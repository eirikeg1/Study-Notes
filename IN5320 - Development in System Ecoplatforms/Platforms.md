# Two ideal types of Platforms

## Transaction platforms
_Middleman/broker_

* Multisided markets
* competition/pricing strategies
* Network effects

## Innovation platforms

* Modularity
* Openness
* Innovation
* Split into **Consumer platforms** and **Industry Platforms**
* Consumer: IOS, Andfroid, Facebook
* Idustry: SAP, ORACLE, Salesforce, dhis2


# Different software platform types

## Biz2consumer - Consumer platforms


## Business to business / industry platforms


# Ecosystem

* Contains core, apps, all actors in design and development etc.

# Core concepts

* **multi sidedness**
	* All actors (platform owner, devs and user) provide value
* **network effects**
	* For each new user, value can increase
	* **Direction** can also be negative, every additional user of system can make it less valuble to others (congestion, misbehavior, poor quality content)
	* **Sidedness**: network effects can be **same-sided** or **cross-sided**
		* **Same-side**: value added to other en-user with every new end user
		* **cross-side**: value increase for app devs (not system devs but usually third party) when user is added
* tipping point
* **lock in**
	* Something is *too big to fail*
	* Ecosystem lock in
	* High switching cost
	* fex QWERTY keyboard is not the most efficient
	* can be good: too valueble
* multi homing
	* Not one clear industry leader
	* Different perspectives and methods
* envelopment
	* Allow platforms to offer services and functionality of another platform
	* Perhaps build around another platform to make your implementation more useful to users
* competetive durability
