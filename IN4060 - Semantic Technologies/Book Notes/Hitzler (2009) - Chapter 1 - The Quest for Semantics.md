# Semantic Web
---
_It's goal is to make knowledge widely accessible and to increase the utility of this knowledge_


* Term coined by Sir Tim Berners-Lee
* Two strands of of closely related endeavors are explained
	* *Building abstract models that captures complexities of the world*
	* *Computing with knowledge*

## Ontology
_A set of predefined assumptions which are considered facts in a specific context_

* One can discuss and argue what multiple different terms, relationships, and concepts mean and include. An ontology is defining a set which is considered true in a context or field
* 
# Building models
---
_Describing the world in abstract terms to allow for an easier understanding of a complex reality_

* Simplified description of certain aspects of reality, used for understanding, structuring or predicting parts of the real world
* Example below describes an early model of the two types of animals: rational and irrational ones

## Types of models
* **Scientific models** are the main focus in this book
* **Numerical models** are usually described using formulas


## Scientific Modeling

### Classification
* classifying different things into hierarchical classes
* **Taxonomy** is the term for the *science* of classification
* Can be done for both natural and humanmade objects, so both animals and books
* Words are often classified in a hierarchical manner
* Modern modeling approaches often allows objects to belong to multiple categories, in contrast to more traditional ones (Rather choose something based on a combination of criteria, rather then a very specified criteria)

### Calculating with Knowledge
_Its own field which intersects with Scientific Modeling_

* There are a set of observations which can be used in many different use cases
* **Syllogisms** are rules which are made from words to domain independent variables
* Using **syllogisms** you can do logical operations and logical deductions
* Can make powerful expressions using symbols like $\Sigma, \Pi, \forall, \exists$
* **Logicism** is the belief that all rational thought is based on mathematics which can be broken down to logic. 
	* More precisely: all mathematical truth can be deduced from a few **axioms**
* For example can *A*, *B* and *C* be translated to *Greek*, *Mortal* and *Men*

# Web 2.0
---
_Trend of adding more structure to web resources_

* **Web services**: web servers which returns result based on input
* Most news sites export data through **RSS** or **Atom** feeds

## Semantic web technologies

* **The Semantic Web** is an extension of the **World Wide Web**, but not a concrete extension but an ideal to strive towards
* **TSW** allows computers to intelligently search, combine and process web content based on the meaning that this content has to humans
* In order to allow this, with the absence of human-level intelligence, resources has to be explicitly specified in a format that is processable in a machine-processable syntax


## Semantic Modeling

* **OWL 2** is a modern **SWL** language
