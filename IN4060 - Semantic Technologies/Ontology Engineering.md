_To create effective ontologies_

* It can be useful to use templates, like from [[Reasonable Ontology Templates (OTTR)|OTTR]] to simplify the complexity with abstractions
## Three main problems
1. Understanding the target domain
2. Identifying relevant abstractions over the domain e.g. "A panda is a mammal that eats only bamboo"
3. Formulating abstractions in a formal language like description logics

## Requirements
* If used for integration and communication, it should be generic, stable over time and precise

## Challenges

### Understanding the domain
* What to model
* Communication between ontology experts and domain experts

### How to model it
* Every mammal is either  male or female
	* As classes, properties, ...
* Depends on how it will be used

### Maintenance
* Fixing error
* Update ontology to support new use-cases
* Keeping ontology readable
	* navigation
	* Correct modularization
*
