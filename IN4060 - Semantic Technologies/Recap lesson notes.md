### Lecture 4
* Negation as a failure
	* Use true facts to check negation facts (martin does not have a father -> search for martins father connection)
	* If data format is compatible, can be used to assure [[Model Semantics & Reasoning#Monotonicity|Monotonicity]] #Maybe 
* RDF dataset vs graph
	* Dataset can contain multiple graphs
	* `FROM` vs `FROM NAMED`
### Lecture 7
* ...

### Lecture 8
* two kinds of consequence
	* RDFS rules and model semantics
* $\models$ is entailment, with - instead of = it means it is a logical consequence #Maybe 

### L09-10
* ABox and TBox - RBox?

### Other
* (De?) Morgans Law
	* $\exists R.C\equiv\neg\forall{R}.\neg C$
	* ...
* $\neg\exists R.\top\equiv\forall R.\bot$
