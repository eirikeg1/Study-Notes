### Bounded factors

* **Bounded resources**
	* Scalability issues
	* Innovation limitation
* **Bounded knowledge**
	* Inability to foresee market trends
	* Technical shortcomings
* **Bounded creativity**
	* Lack of innovation
	* User experience and design  limitations
* Mitigating these challenges:
	* Leveraging the ecosystem by effectively leveraging the ecosystem of developers and users. For instance open innovation and crowdsourcing can bring in new ideas and solutions
	* Strategic partnerships and alliances
	* Continuous learning and adaptation
	* Fostering a creative culture


### Other factors based on platform architecture
* **Massively Distributed innovation**
	* Decentralization of innovation activities across a wide network of external developers and contributors rather than relying solely on internal resources
	* Increases innovation and speed of developing improvements due to more contributors and competition
	* Platforms can scale quicker when capitalizing on third party innovations
	* Can be bad to be too reliant on third party developers, both for innovation and quality control
* **Risk transfer**
	* Shifts some risk over to external developers
	* Platform don't need to invest as heavily in every feature which lowers the **financial risk**, also increases flexibility
	* Can potentially create **misalignment**, where third parties prioritizes their own interests over the platforms strategic role
* **Capturing the long-tail**
	_Concept of catering to a wide array of niche markets and preferences, rather than solely the mass market_
	* Access to niche markets which might otherwise be uneconomical to reach
	* Can be complex to manage a diverse range of apps and services
	* Resource allocation can be a challenge with multiple different features for prioritization
* **Competitive Sustainability**
	_Platforms ability to maintain its competitive advantage over time_
	* **Long-term viability** ensures the platform remains relevant and competitive
	* **Adaptability** is important for the platform to evolve with the market and its trends
	* Can require a lot of continuous investments in innovation and adaptation
