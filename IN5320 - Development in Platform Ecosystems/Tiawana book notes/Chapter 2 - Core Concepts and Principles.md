# Main lessons learned

* *Strategies that are appropriate for managing platforms and apps vary with where they are in the evolutionary lifecycle*. The lifecycle of a technology solution is a three-dimensional property that encompasses whether it is in the pre- or post-dominant design stage, where it falls in the technology maturity trajectory (the S-curve), and what proportion of the total prospective user base has already adopted it. 
* *Software platforms have intrinsically different properties compared to other types of platforms.* Their multisidedness offers fertile opportunities to create both same-side and cross-side network effects, lock-ins that can be both coercive and value-driven, and the prospects of swallowing adjacent platforms as well as the dangers of being swallowed by one. 
* *Architectures of technology solutions provide the blueprint for mass coordination.* The conventional coordination and control mechanisms that work well in conventional organizations and supply chains are prohibitively costly and implausible to use in large ecosystems. Architecture instead provides the blueprint for both partitioning innovation work across the many participants in a platform ecosystem and for integrating it. 
* *Governance can amplify or diminish the advantages of good architecture*. Governance and architecture must be codesigned and coevolved because they act as the two gears of a platform’s evolutionary motor. A misfit between the two can lead to evolutionary penalties and the eventual demise of a previously successful technology solution. 2.4 Lessons Learned 47 
* *Evolutionary pace of a platform is relative to its rivals*. A platform must evolve at least as rapidly as its rivals to remain viable (the Red Queen effect). 
* *Emergent innovation can only be facilitated, not planned by a platform owner*. Most innovations around platforms are emergent in the sense that they spontaneously arise from the selfish pursuit of self-interest by individual ecosystem participants. A platform owner must make the ecosystem conducive to such emergent innovation to fully realize the potential of platform ecosystems. 
* *New platforms must overcome the chicken-or-egg problem and the penguin problem to get off the ground*. The multisided nature of platforms makes it unattractive for either side to join unless there is a critical mass on the other side. App developers, for example, will find a platform attractive only if it has a large pool of prospective users; users will find a platform attractive only if there is a large variety of apps to complement the platform. Uncertainty about whether others will join the platform ecosystem can stall initial adoption, creating the penguin problem. Governance tuned to different phases of a platform’s lifecycle (Figure 2.1) can help overcome these startup problems. 
* *Platforms must be designed to overcome three problems that can impede their evolution*. First, platform owners must balance the need to grant sufficient autonomy to app developers to innovate freely without compromising integration of their work into the platform’s ecosystem (the seesaw problem). Second, apps must be separable from the platform to freely evolve, but it must also be easy to subsequently reintegrate them with the platform (the Humpty Dumpty problem). Third, how innovation work is organized should mirror the architecture of the platform and the “microarchitecture” (see Chapter 5) of individual apps (the mirroring principle).

## The rule of one
_In a standard Platform ecosystem a single design or standard can become predominant due to Network effects and the evolution of complementary products_

* Increasing returns to adoption: Due to network effects a design or pattern becomes more valuable as more people adopt it. The more a dominant design us used, the more it is improved upon, enhancing its appeal and utility
* Emergence of specialized complements. As a dominant design becomes more widely adopted, it leads to the development of more specialized complementary products or services. This creates a **self-reinforcing feedback loop**, where the dominant design becomes increasingly more dominant

## S-curve and leapfrogging
_S-curves shows technologies lifecycle that describes its progression from introduction, ascent maturity and decline phases. Leapfrogging means changing technology to a technology with an ascending s-curve as their current s curve is at its peak and starts to decline_
