_The optimal governance structure is the simplest one that achieves the goals of a platform at the least cost_

# Governance as orchestration

* Governance determines whether the innovation potential of a modular platform architecture is realized through value co-creation
* Platform owner orchestrates to ensure overall coherence
* governance is the mechanisms through which a platform owner exerts influence over app developers

# Governance varies by type of Software Platform

* Governance must be considered based on industry and public/private sector
	* Does it have to give benefits in the start or can the profits be subsidised?
	* Does it benefit tax payers?

# Three dimensions of governance
---
# Decision rights

#### Mirroring principle
* Partitioning of decision rights between owner and app devs should mirror platforms architecture
* Rights must be aligned with who has knowledge  to make decisions

#### Partitioning
* Division of authority and responsibilities between p owner and app dev
* **strategic**: what is the platform or app to accomplish
* **implementation**: how will the platform or app accomplish it?

# Control portfolio
*How platform owner creates goal convergence and facilitates coordination with devs*

#### Control mechanisms
* Tools that owners use to implemetn/enforce rules that reward desireble behavior and punush bad behaviour![[Pasted image 20231106144602.png | 700]]


# Pricing policies

* incentives must be compelling enough  to encourage devs to make personal investments to ensure the prosperity of their own app offerings, and in turn the vibrancy of the platform ecosystem as a whole

### 5 pricing policies
* **Symmetric** or **asymmetric** pricing for the two sides of the platform?
* if asymmetric, who to subsidise and for how long?
	* For example in gaming industry console price might be subsidized to be below manufacturing cost in order to increase users and in turn devs and profits from sources within the platform
* Pricing for access vs usage?
* Pie-splitting using a fixed scale or a sliding window
* App pricing/licensing decisions


# Knowledge boundary resources
---

## Private B2B/industry platforms

* Platform strategy in enterprise software involves "moving the locus of product development from within the firm toward independent third‐party firms, so‐called complementors"
* "Use the strength of other software/applications"
* Implementation of enterprise software conducted by complementors in collaboration with user organisations involves matching user need with software platform features
* Complementors need to know how to access, combine and extend platform functionality in order to develop add-on products and services
	* Not good if everyone makes the same applications over and over again
	* Instead use products from other companies to create something new and useful
* ![[Pasted image 20231106153959.png | 500]]
* Enterprise software platforms are complex - complementing them requires knowledge
	* Logic/features of the platform core
	* Roadmap of the platform owner
	* Innovations from other complementors/partners
* Knowledge boundary resources address knowledge gaps/boundaries

## Tradeoff in terms of scope and scale

* Knowledge about the right scope: to overcome knowledge boundary
* Knowledge at the right scale: how many distinct complementors covered the platfrom leader provide knowledge boundary resources to enable platform complementors to participate in value-adding innovation

## Boundary Resource & Knowledge Boundary Resource

* The software tools and regulations serve as the interface for the close relationship between platform owner and app dev.
