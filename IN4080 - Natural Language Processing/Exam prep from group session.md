---
## Phonetics

* Dialogue systems/speech detection
* signals (waveforms/specgrams)
* different tokens have different length
* Usually use overlapping vectors/frames to analyse

## Morphology
*Creating meaningful words from subsections*

* Prefixes, suffixes has specific meanings (pre- means before)
* In norwegian double words are put into one word
* In spanish the end of the words tells us the tense and the person/people taking the action

## Syntax
_How to construct meaningful sentences_

* POS tagging
	* Same word can have multiple meanings (to **book** a hotel or to read a **book**)
* Tokens
* Types (vocabulary)
* Type token ratio $\dfrac{type}{token}$, defined by *Zipf*

## Semantics
_Meaning of words and how the meanings relate to each other_

* Synonyms, antonyms
* hypernyms, hyponyms (parent and subclasses, animal is hypernym of reptile)
	* Always makes sense to refer to the hypernym in a context, but not the other way around

###  Name Entity Recognition
 _Detecting names and entities_
* A name does not have to be an own entity (fex. *Oslo* in *the University of Oslo*)
* BIO (Beginning, Internal, Outer) tags

## Pragmatics
_Speaker and context dependant_

* Deixis (meaning is derived from context fex: here, there, you, me, ...)
* Grounding/signals (alignment/intent)

### Speech acts 
#Useful 
* Not all statements are either true or false
* Assertives (stating something to be true)
* Directives (statement to influence someones behaviour, *go away*, *isn't it cold without a jacket?*)
* Expressive (statement to express a sentiment, *I think it is cold outside*)
* Comnisives 
* Declaratives 
	* Changes the world by their utterance, 
	* Feks*I declare you husband and wife* is part of the legally binding ritual of marriage, so without those words its not a marriage
* Implicatures

### Gric's marims
_Unstated rules everyone know for good communication_
* When one is broken, we asume something is going on which is not said
* **Quality** (One say that which is true)
* **Quantity** (Provide right amount of information)
* **Relation** (Only say which is relevant)
* **Manner** (avoid ambiguity)
