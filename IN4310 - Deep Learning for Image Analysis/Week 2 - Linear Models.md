## Basic components of ML problems

* Dataset
* Model (hypothesis class)
* Learning algorithm


# Discriminative ML

* Predictor/classifier $h_w$: input space $X\rightarrow Y$
* Model has trainable parameters $w$ (weights and biases)
* Use (feature, label) training data and loss function to optimize $w$

# Image classification

* Input: image, output: number of bounding boxes
* 

## Loss Functions


## Empirical risk minimization (ERM)
_Process of minimizing the empirical risk (usually loss over all data)
