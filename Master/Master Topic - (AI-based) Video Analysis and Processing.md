# Master topic
* [Project Topic at UiO.no](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/studier/masteroppgaver/nd/2021-AI-based-video-processing.html)
* [Project Description](obsidian://open?vault=StudyNotes&file=Master%2FProject%20Description.pdf)
* Because this is a field with a lot of changes the project will be selected when I start writing. It will be scoped down during the essay but will still be a little general
*

# Examples from supervisor
---
* Automated AI-based event detection systems
* Automated AI-based clipping systems
* Automated AI-based summarization systems
* Investigate gamification solutions for users


# Possible own scoping
---

## Optical flow fields or other directional features
* [[Real-Time Detection of Events in Soccer Videos using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks]]

## Not tagged event detection
*Goals, possible chances, entertaining passes/dribbles etc.*
* Train with videos + commentator data

## General summarization for multiple platforms/formats
*Make summaries which works for different platforms for example youtube, tiktok and instagram, which uses different time limits and aspect ratios*

## Different preprocessing - entity detection?
*Use entity detection to scope down the different factors, for example only coordinates/info of players and ball*
* Less factors might increase accuracy and decrease resource use
