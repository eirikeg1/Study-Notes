### Player re-identification
* Use soccernet implementation
* Swap HRNet-w32 baseline with FastReID + IBN as even if it is a little bit less robust, it is much faster and might be better for different stadiums and environments
* FastReID should be better for varying camera angles and different lighting and weather conditions
