## Machine learning theory

### Machine learning introduction
* Why is this relevant for Thesis?
### Foundational machine learning theory
* General machine learning
* Supervised learning
	* Dataset-types used in pipeline
	* Short about **GIGO** (Garbage In Garbage Out)
* Classification
* Transfer learning
### Neural Networks
* Classic feed-forward
* CNNs
* Object Detection
* Single-Shot Detector?
	* YOLO pipeline
* Other model-architectures used in pipeline (if just a small modification this can be moved into the pipeline; but only if it can be summarized in max a couple sentences)
### Deep learning/computer vision theory
* Fundamental image processing theory
* Object tracking
* Action recognition
* Segmentation
* Classification
### Evaluation metrics
* Accuracy
* Precision, recall, f1
* Loss
* User feedback?

* If there are other State Of The Art pipelines, perhaps mention them?
* Differences between Forzify pipeline and other approaches
### Other thesis's/problems I extend my work on?
* If I decide to continue on a similar problem another master student has worked on and extend his work
* How does my work build upon/differ from their
