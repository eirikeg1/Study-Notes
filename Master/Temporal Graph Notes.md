## Time Series
* [A Survey on Graph Neural Networks for Time Series: Forecasting, Classification, Imputation, and Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03759)
* Chapter **GNNS FOR TIME SERIES CLASSIFICATION** most important
## Graph Attention Networks
* [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)
* Particularly relevant for football data as player interactions are constantly changing
* Original implementation on github (or pytorch geometric)
* Personal implementation from IN5310 course
