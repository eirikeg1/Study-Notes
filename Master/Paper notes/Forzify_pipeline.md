_Social media plays a significant role for sports organizations with millions of active fans, but publishing highlights is often a tedious manual operation. With the development of AI, new tools are avail- able for content generation and personalization to engage audiences. We propose an AI-based multimedia production framework for the automatic publishing of soccer and ice hockey highlights on social media, and disseminate our experiences with developing dedicated pipelines for event detection and classification, player detection and tracking, highlight clipping, cropping, thumbnail generation, game summarization, caption generation, and social media sharing._
