* Because this is a field with a lot of changes the project will be selected when I start writing. It will be scoped down during the essay but will still be a little general

# Examples from supervisor
---
* Automated AI-based event detection systems
* Automated AI-based clipping systems
* Automated AI-based summarization systems
* Investigate gamification solutions for users


# Possible own scoping
---
## Not tagged event detection
*Entertaining passes, dribbles etc.*
* Train with videos + commentator data

## General summarization for multiple platforms/formats
*Make summaries which works for different platforms for example youtube, tiktok and instagram, which uses different time limits and aspect ratios*

## Different preprocessing - entity detection?
*Use entity detection to scope down the different factors, for example only coordinates/info of players and ball*
* Less factors might increase accuracy and decrease resource use
