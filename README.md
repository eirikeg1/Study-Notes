# Study-Notes

My notes for master subjects. I use [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to write the notes. I use a plugin to write latex-style formulas.

Most images and links are made using `Wikilink`notation, therefore they will not be visible in GitHub.

The vault is structured with each course in its own folder. Each course has a file called `Course Page - [course code]`, which gives an overview with links to everything contained in the course ([example](obsidian://open?vault=StudyNotes&file=IN5550%20-%20Neural%20Methods%20for%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%2FCourse%20Page%20-%20IN5550)). Still, notes in a course can freely link to notes, or headlines, in another course's notes.
