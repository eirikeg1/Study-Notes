# Study-Notes
My notes for master subjects. I use [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to write the notes. I use a plugin to write latex-style formulas.

Most images and links are made using `Wikilink`notation, therefore they will not be visible in GitHub.

The vault is structured with each course in its own folder. Each course has a file called `Course Page - [course code]`, which gives an overview with links to everything contained in the course. [Example](IN5550 - )
