# Overview
---

My notes for master subjects. I use [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to write the notes. I use a plugin to write latex-style formulas.  Obsidian is recommended to view the notes, as some formatting might look weird in `GitHub` or other markdown editors.

Most images and links are made using `Wikilink`notation, therefore they will not be visible in GitHub.

The vault is structured with each course in its own folder. Each course has a file called `Course Page - [course name]`, which gives an overview with links to everything contained in the course ([example](obsidian://open?vault=StudyNotes&file=IN5550%20-%20Neural%20Methods%20for%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%2FCourse%20Page%20-%20IN5550)). Still, notes in a course can freely link to notes, or headlines, in other course's notes.

# Configuration
---
_My recommended configuration for using this vault_

## Recommended theme
_Notes are made and formatted to look nice with this theme_

* Optional, but I recommend a theme where different title sizes have different colors, as hierarchy is used to structure notes
* Tokyo theme
* There are no links, but it can be found in obsidian: `settings -> appearance -> Themes -> manage`

## Image toolkit
_Clicking an image shows the image in fullscreen, with additional options_

* Can be very useful in these notes, as some images might be a bit small
* [Image Toolkit](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-image-toolkit) in Obsidian store

## Hover external link
_Shows a small window of link destination when hover over while holding `ctrl`_

* Optional, but useful as links are heavily utilized for keywords around in notes
* [Hover external link](obsidian://show-plugin?id=hover-external-link) in Obsidian store
